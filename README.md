# -100DaysOfRTL
🛠️ #100DaysOfRTL — 100 RTL Design Projects in Verilog Welcome to #100DaysOfRTL — a personal challenge to master digital design by building 100 RTL projects using Verilog. Each day is dedicated to implementing, simulating, and documenting one digital design concept, from basic logic gates to processors.

📚 What’s Inside?
This repo includes:
-✅ 100 RTL design projects
-💡 Descriptions and design logic
-💻 Verilog implementation
-🧪 Testbenches and simulations
-📊 Waveform results
-🧠 Key learnings and notes

🔥 Why #100DaysOfRTL?
This challenge is inspired by #100DaysOfCode but focused on RTL design and hardware development. By completing this challenge, you'll:
-Gain practical Verilog experience
-Understand combinational & sequential logic
-Learn memory, FSMs, arithmetic units, and even CPU components
-Improve your debugging, simulation, and documentation skills

🧱 Topics Covered
-Logic Gates (NAND, XOR, etc.)
-Arithmetic Units (ALU, Multiplier, Divider)
-FSMs (Traffic Light, Vending Machine)
-Interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C)
-Memory (SRAM, ROM, FIFO, Cache)
-CPU Building Blocks (Register File, Control Unit, RISC-V Core)

📈 Progress Tracker
-Check progress.md to follow the 100-day streak!
